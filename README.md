# Evolutionary Genomics of the Lactobacillus Genus Complex: data analysis

This repository contains R Markdown scripts to analyze the results generated by the [legen pipeline](https://github.com/SWittouck/legen_pipeline). It also includes the necessary data files so that it is not required to run the pipeline yourself in order to repeat and/or play around with the data analysis.

This data analysis has been published as a preprint on bioRxiv:
