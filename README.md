# Lactobacillus species taxonomy

This repository contains code to analyze the species-level taxonomy of the Lactobacillus Genus Complex (families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae). The input for these analyses is generated by the [legen pipeline](https://github.com/SWittouck/legen_pipeline). The data folder contains all necessary files to run the analyses so it is not required to run the legen pipeline yourself in order to repeat and/or play around with the data analysis.

The results of this analysis have been published in mSystems:
